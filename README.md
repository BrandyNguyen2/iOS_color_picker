# CPSC 411 Assignment 1 (10/28)
Programmed by: Brandy Nguyen
## Description:
An iOS app that allows users to pick and choose what color they want from using a slider of 3 colors: red, green, and blue. The intensity of each is determined by a number between 0 and 1. The user can set this value directly or through a slider. Additionally, there is an on/off switch for each color. When a switch is off, the value 0 is to be applied. Also, the corresponding slider and number slot should be disabled. Upon turning it back on, its value should return to what it was before turning it off. There should also be a reset button that sets everything back to the initial values when the application starts. The app also contains persistence. If you swipe out or close the app, and then reopen it. All of your previous information is saved and will be restored.
